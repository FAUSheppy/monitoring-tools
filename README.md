# Sheppy's Monitoring Tools
This is a collection of monitoring tools I use on my server in addition to [icinga-passive-checks-monitoring](https://github.com/FAUSheppy/icinga-passive-checks-monitoring).

To use the Telegram Notifications you have to set up my [HTTP-\>telegram Gateway](https://github.com/FAUSheppy/telegram-http-gateway).
